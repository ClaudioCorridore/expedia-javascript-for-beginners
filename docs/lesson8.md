We arrived to the final lesson.

Before moving to the last exercises for this course, I would like to spend some minutes to give you three final tips:

1. ## Break it down
Most of the time a complex task is nothing more than a set of simple small tasks.
You should always try to keep your code simple and clean.

2. ## Don't be afraid of making mistakes
When you are writing some code, don't be afraid of messing a bit. Most of the time the errors will be harmless and even more important, you will learn a lot from them.

3. ## The ego is your enemy.
The ego is a big problem for many developers. As soon as you start getting confidence in coding you may fall in this trap. Here are some rules to remember:
* When you don't know something, ask for help. The best part of this world is the community.
* Even if you know how to solve an issue, always look for other people solutions. Despite what some people could thing, developing is all about creativity, and to be creative you will need inspiration.
* Don't try to be too smart. Sometimes is nice to challenge yourself, but most of the times you should try to make your code as clear and simple as possible. More people can understand what you are doing, more help you will receive.

These were my final tips for you, now you should have some of the pieces required to become a JavaScript developer
